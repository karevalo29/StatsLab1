# Problem 1
## Compute the sum of the sequence 100 to 1000, going up by a constant value of 100
```{r}
sum(seq(100,1000,100))

```

# Problem 2
## Compute the sum of these numbers, (1,3,2,4,3,5,4,3,4,5,6,5,6,7,6,5,6,5,4,3,4,5)
```{r}
sum(c(1,3,2,4,3,5,4,3,4,5,6,5,6,7,6,5,6,5,4,3,4,5))
```

# Problem 3
## Write a custom sequence generator function using a for loop that generates a sequence from a starting integer value to an ending integer value in steps of 1. Demonstrate that it can produce the sequence 1 to 10.

```{r}
seq_gen <- function(start,end) {
  for(i in start:end){
    print(i)
  }
}

seq_gen(1,10)
```
